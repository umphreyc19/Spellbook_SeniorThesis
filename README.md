# Spellbook_SeniorThesis

Welcome to the Github page for my Android application, Spellbook! Spellbook is an all-purpose app for the trading card game Yu-Gi-Oh! This application allows the user to:
- Calculate life points (via addition, subtraction, and division)
- Simulate a die roll
- Simulate a coin flip
- Use a timer to keep track of how much time there is left in a round
- Reset the values without the need of closing out of the app
- Search a local database for cards via an API (Provided by YGOProDeck.com)

Though this app was not 100% finished for my senior thesis, I aim to continue work on the application, since I still think it is a very handy tool. Currently, the database button stores values from the json file into a HashMap, and these values can easily be accessible and viewed via printlines in the logcat.

# Goals to work on:
- Allow the user to view the HashMap values in a neat and orderly manner
- Allow the user to search inside the HashMap for specific cards
- Figure out why the layout can be wonky at times
